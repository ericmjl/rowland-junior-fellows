title: Predicting influenza virus risk by systematic genotype-phenotype mapping
---

***Introduction:*** One goal of viral genomic surveillance is to use a virus’ sequence to predict how virulent it may be. This is known as "phenotypic interpretation" of genomic data. The current gold standard for viral risk assessment is by single point mutations, but this may not be sufficient because of epistatic effects. **The scientific gap here is a lack of viral protein sequence variants paired with systematically measured phenotype data**. Generating this data will enable us to progress towards a rational phenotypic interpretation, powered by computational models trained to learn sequence-function mapping. As a Rowland Junior Fellow, I aim to (1) develop safe, scalable and standardized assays to systematically measure influenza virus protein variants, and (2) integrate the data generation pipeline with new advances in machine learning to accurately and rapidly predict a virus' risk profile from its sequence. My long-term goal is to build a system for predicting *in silico* a virus' risk from its component proteins’ sequence, without requiring any experimentation on its live form.


We will start by systematically characterizing the phenotype of two influenza proteins: RNA replication rate of the polymerase complex, and drug resistance of the neuraminidase protein. The latter, in particular, is a a clinically-relevant protein to measure. We will use DNA synthesis and assembly methods to generate protein variants, and use robotics to scale our variant library generation and measurement steps. We will then scale established assays for measuring neuraminidase and polymerase activity in a 96-well microplate format, and standardize the measurements by using a standard reference control. The data generated will be a gold-standard, dense measurement of influenza viral properties, and will be released under a public license. We will also build new assays for systematically measuring other influenza viral proteins' biochemical phenotypes, and leveraging our genetic systems to rapidly test other emerging pathogens. Our long-term goal here is to develop a generalizable experimental system for biochemically testing any new virus' proteins and its variants.

***Aim 2: Computational prediction.*** The data from Aim 1 can be leveraged for predicting viral protein activity from sequence. This problem can essentially be cast as learning a non-linear mapping from genotype space to phenotype space. **We will use  supervised learning algorithms to learn this mapping, while also partnering with current collaborators to develop more interpretable learning algorithms optimized for this task.** The models will be constructed using free and open source software (e.g. `autograd` and `scikit-learn`), and will be integrated into a web-based viral phenotype prediction system, in which end users may input a viral protein sequence and have the predicted relevant phenotypes returned. All software developed will be released freely under a public license.

***Synthesis:*** With our data generation (Aim 1) and computational prediction (Aim 2) pipelines, **we will build an integrated and continually updated viral phenotypic interpretation system**. Such a system may enable epidemiologists to monitor and predict which aspects of a virus' phenotype are trending towards danger. For example, if circulating strains are increasing in drug resistance but remain antigenically similar to current vaccine strain, and the most effective tailored outbreak response would be deploying vaccines instead of drugs. Our phenotypic interpretation system may also help guide clinical decision making, such as recommending drug combinations that a patient's virus population would be most sensitive to. With an integrated experimental and computational pipeline, our machine learning models can also be refined in real-time as new viral protein variants are discovered and tested.

***Fellowship Support and Funding:*** The Rowland Institute can provide the necessary environment and support for this endeavour, as access to custom fabrication facilities and stable funding over the 5 years at the Rowland Institute will also help us establish the necessary experimental infrastructure. In pursuit of the research goals described above, I have also co-written and won Broad *Next10* grant applications totalling $80,000, and have led the submission of an NIH R21 grant with my current advisor Jonathan Runstadler and collaborator David Duvenaud. I can foresee other funding agencies being interested in this effort, such as DARPA and the Gates Foundation. In order to ensure that our research and engineering efforts are self-sustaining, we will also explore data access & licensing models with interested industry partners.
